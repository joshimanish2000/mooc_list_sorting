This scripts calculates number of registrations in a partcular MOOC course. It also groups the course hours and number of courses lasting that long. 
This script takes a file as an input from the command line. Depending on the structure of your csv file, some changes might have to be made in the script (indexing).
A csv file for demonstration is included in the repo.

Note: If you open your file in excel or its libre counterpart save it with xlsx extension, then convert that file into csv using 'ssconvert'
e.g. ssconvert foo.xlsx foo.csv # you need gnumeric in your pc for this to work.
